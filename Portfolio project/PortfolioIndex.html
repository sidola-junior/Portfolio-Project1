      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, as you already know from the title my name is Siddiq, but what you don't know is that I am
        a 22 year old Sport and Exercise Science graduate of the University of Brighton. I am currently
        learning how to program in Python from one of Udemy's top selling courses.
      </p>

      <h3>The Basics:</h3>

      <p>
        The basics, this was the first language within the coding domain I learnt and I mean it was fun learning it at the time
        of learn it I did find some parts confusing but that is to be expected when learning something brand new.
        I can now say I am very confident in writing clear-cut HTML with no problems, understanding how it all works.
      </p>

        CSS was excited because up until this point I had just been learning html and was adding style through that,
        which of course is not ideal, but this was again another learning curve, which took some time to understand
        the syntax. However what I will say is that learning CSS where I did helped me pick up some very good programming
        habits.
      </p>
      <h3>The Other Stuff:</h3>

      <p>
        Moving away from the two mark-up languages, which were great as a starting point, I wanted to get involved
        with more programming languages with more logic etc. To which I came across the Python programming language,
        that I am currently enjoying the learning process through this course on
